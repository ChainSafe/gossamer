> **Warning**

> The Gossamer Polkadot Host is pre-production software [2022-12-01]

Gossamer is a [Golang](https://go.dev/) implementation of the
[Polkadot Host](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-host): an
execution environment for the Polkadot runtime, which is materialized as a Web
Assembly (Wasm) blob. In addition to running an embedded Wasm executor, a
Polkadot Host must orchestrate a number of interrelated services, such as
[networking](dot/network/README.md), block production, block finalization, a
JSON-RPC server, [and more](cmd/gossamer/README.md#client-components).

## Getting Started

To get started with Gossamer, follow the steps below to build the source code
and start a development network.

### Prerequisites

[Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) is required
to acquire the Gossamer source code, and
[Make](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/building-blocks/configure-your-computer/automation-and-workflows/make/)
is used to build it. Building Gossamer requires version 1.19 or higher of
[Golang](https://go.dev/dl/).

### Installation

Clone the [Gossamer](https://github.com/ChainSafe/gossamer) repository and
checkout the `development` branch:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ChainSafe/gossamer
cd gossamer
git checkout development
```

Build Gossamer:

```sh
make gossamer
```

Or build Gossamer _and_ move the resulting executable to `$GOPATH/bin`:

```sh
make install
```

To install Gossamer

**Note**: Apple Silicon users running aarch64 might run into issues 
with our wasm interpreter since wasmer is still working on supporting this architecture.
See their [README](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-go) for me info on supported platforms.
Currently, there are no known issues regarding this within the Gossamer repo, but if you run into one please open an issue
on our GitHub.

## Use Gossamer

A comprehensive guide to
[Gossamer's end-user capabilities](cmd/gossamer/README.md) is located in the
`cmd/gossamer` directory. What follows is a guide to Gossamer's capabilities as
a Polkadot Host.

### Chain Specifications

A chain specification is a JSON document that defines the
[genesis](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/glossary#genesis) block of a
blockchain network, as well as network parameters and metadata (e.g. network
name, bootnodes,
[telemetry endpoints](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-node-management#monitoring-and-telemetry),
etc). It is necessary to provide Gossamer with a chain specification in order to
use it as a Polkadot Host. The Gossamer repository includes a number of chain
specifications, some of which will be used in this guide.

### Configuration Files

Gossamer exposes a number of configuration parameters, such as the location of a
chain specification file. Although it's possible to use command-line parameters,
this guide will focus on the usage of Gossamer TOML configuration files, which
define a set of configuration values in a declarative, portable, reusable
format. The chain specifications that are used in this guide are each
accompanied by one or more configuration files.

### Single-Node Development Network

The name of the Polkadot test network is "Westend", and the Gossamer repository
includes a chain specification and configuration file for a single-node, local
Westend test network.

First, initialize the directory that will be used by the Gossamer node to manage
its state:

```sh
./bin/gossamer init --force --config ./chain/westend-dev/config.toml
```

Now, start Gossamer as a host for the local Westend development chain:

```sh
./bin/gossamer --config ./chain/westend-dev/config.toml
```

### Multi-Node Development Network

The multi-node development network includes three participants: the Alice, Bob,
and Charlie test accounts. In three separate terminals, initialize the data
directories for the three Gossamer instances:

```sh
./bin/gossamer init --force --config ./chain/westend-local/config-alice.toml
```

```sh
./bin/gossamer init --force --config ./chain/westend-local/config-bob.toml
```

```sh
./bin/gossamer init --force --config ./chain/westend-local/config-charlie.toml
```

Then start the three hosts:

```sh
./bin/gossamer --config ./chain/westend-local/config-alice.toml
```

```sh
./bin/gossamer --config ./chain/westend-local/config-bob.toml
```

```sh
./bin/gossamer --config ./chain/westend-local/config-charlie.toml
```
