/**
 * @name createPair
 * @summary Creates a keyring pair object
 * @description Creates a keyring pair object with provided account public key, metadata, and encoded arguments.
 * The keyring pair stores the account state including the encoded address and associated metadata.
 *
 * It has properties whose values are functions that may be called to perform account actions:
 *
 * - `address` function retrieves the address associated with the account.
 * - `decodedPkcs8` function is called with the account passphrase and account encoded public key.
 * It decodes the encoded public key using the passphrase provided to obtain the decoded account public key
 * and associated secret key that are then available in memory, and changes the account address stored in the
 * state of the pair to correspond to the address of the decoded public key.
 * - `encodePkcs8` function when provided with the correct passphrase associated with the account pair
 * and when the secret key is in memory (when the account pair is not locked) it returns an encoded
 * public key of the account.
 * - `meta` is the metadata that is stored in the state of the pair, either when it was originally
 * created or set via `setMeta`.
 * - `publicKey` returns the public key stored in memory for the pair.
 * - `sign` may be used to return a signature by signing a provided message with the secret
 * key (if it is in memory) using Nacl.
 * - `toJson` calls another `toJson` function and provides the state of the pair,
 * it generates arguments to be passed to the other `toJson` function including an encoded public key of the account
 * that it generates using the secret key from memory (if it has been made available in memory)
 * and the optionally provided passphrase argument. It passes a third boolean argument to `toJson`
 * indicating whether the public key has been encoded or not (if a passphrase argument was provided then it is encoded).
 * The `toJson` function that it calls returns a JSON object with properties including the `address`
 * and `meta` that are assigned with the values stored in the corresponding state variables of the account pair,
 * an `encoded` property that is assigned with the encoded public key in hex format, and an `encoding`
 * property that indicates whether the public key value of the `encoded` property is encoded or not.
